  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  With or without an internet connection, the user can generate notes or code snippets in the program, and they can be safely retrieved for use at a later time. The application will continue to function properly even when there is no active internet connection thanks to the integrated service worker and Cache APIs. Even when the app is offline, the user may view previously visited sites thanks to this program.
